_Report and tutorial on reproducible scientific writing_

Just started writing this report, updates will come. I'm showing exemples of how SCons can be used to compile code, downlaod data and produce figures to be included in a LaTeX docoment for publishing. The document is very messy, with the purpose of showing different techniques and inspire the reader. 

The work is highely inspierd by the Madagascar project.
